# LIS624-documentation
This is the readme for the LIS624-documentation Github repository, which will serve as the repo for all my work going forward in the LIS624: Systems Librarianship course. Using Github is very useful for working with code on projects like this, where multiple people will have to be collaborating on the same project. This could include:
* Using Github in a work environment
* Using Github for school (which is what I am using it for now!)
* Using Github for a personal project (The one other time I have used Github was for a shared video game development project, which was for neither work nor school. That was ~5 years ago, however.)

This readme will be much more descriptive in the future, as work in the LIS624: Systems Librarianship course continues!
